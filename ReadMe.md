# Context-Sensitive Delta Inference for Identifying Workload-Dependent Performance Bottlenecks

Software hang problems are one of the most common problems reported by users. Some software hang problems are constantly expensive, that is, these do not depend on the workload. On the other hand, some depend on workload which are called workload-dependent performance bottlenecks (WDPBs). The main goal of this project is to implement the mechanism to identify workload-dependent performance bottlenecks in a context sensitive way. The base paper is "Context-Sensitive Delta Inference for Identifying Workload-Dependent Performance Bottlenecks" by Xiao et al. [1](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2483784). The work is extended by considering multiple workload parameter rather than a single one.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
